# alarmclock
This is my very own alarm clock with built time setup, alarm setup, and even sound!

Updates:
- 2/18: added backlight control + fixed some bugs 
- 2/20: added snooze button + currently figuring out built-in sync
- 2/21: figured out built-in sync + seeing which values work best

Features that I plan to add later on include:
  - Something to display the weather. Will need to purchase additional parts to do so.
  - Pulley system to open up my blinds
