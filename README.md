# alarmclock
This is my very own alarm clock with built time setup, alarm setup, and even sound!

Updates:
- 2/18: added backlight control + fixed some bugs 
- 2/20: added snooze button + currently figuring out built-in sync

Features that I plan to add later on include:
  - Built-in sync (trying for every hour)
  - Pulley system to open up my blinds
