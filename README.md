# alarmclock
This is my very own alarm clock with built time setup, alarm setup, and even sound!

Updates:
- 2/18: added backlight control + fixed some bugs 

Features that I plan to add later on include:
  - Snooze Button
  - Built-in sync (trying for every hour)
  - Actual songs (as alarm sound)
  - Pulley system to open up my blinds
