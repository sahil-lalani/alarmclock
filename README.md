# alarmclock
This is my very own alarm clock with built time setup, alarm setup, and even sound!

Updates:
- 2/18: added backlight control + fixed some bugs 
- 2/20: added snooze button + currently figuring out built-in sync
- 2/21: figured out built-in sync + seeing which values work best
- 3/4: fixed snooze button
- 3/7: removed snooze button + added ultrasonic sensor for turning on LCD & snoozing alarm

Features that I plan to add later on include:
  - Infrared sensor to turn on LCD display with my hand.
  - Pulley system to open up my blinds
